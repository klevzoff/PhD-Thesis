abstract = {We present a novel spatiotemporal-adaptive Multiscale Finite Volume (MsFV) method, which is based on the natural idea that the global coarse-scale problem has longer characteristic time than the local fine-scale problems. As a consequence, the global problem can be solved with larger time steps than the local problems. In contrast to the pressure-transport splitting usually employed in the standard MsFV approach, we propose to start directly with a local-global splitting that allows to locally retain the original degree of coupling. This is crucial for highly non-linear systems or in the presence of physical instabilities. To obtain an accurate and efficient algorithm, we devise new adaptive criteria for global update that are based on changes of coarse-scale quantities rather than on fine-scale quantities, as it is routinely done before in the adaptive MsFV method. By means of a complexity analysis we show that the adaptive approach gives a noticeable speed-up with respect to the standard MsFV algorithm. In particular, it is efficient in case of large upscaling factors, which is important for multiphysics problems. Based on the observation that local time stepping acts as a smoother, we devise a self-correcting algorithm which incorporates the information from previous times to improve the quality of the multiscale approximation. We present results of multiphase flow simulations both for Darcy-scale and multiphysics (hybrid) problems, in which a local pore-scale description is combined with a global Darcy-like description. The novel spatiotemporal-adaptive multiscale method based on the local-global splitting is not limited to porous media flow problems, but it can be extended to any system described by a set of conservation equations.},

abstract = {Simulation of density-driven instabilities requires flexible methods to deal with the different spatial and temporal scales involved. Downscaling approaches based on standard adaptive grid refinement aim at resolving the fine-scale details only in the region of interest, but they may become computationally expensive in presence of very corrugated unstable fronts because the problem to be solved approaches the size of the fully refined system. The Downscaling Multiscale Finite-Volume (DMsFV) method overcomes this issue by splitting the problems into a set of localized subproblems that interact only through a global problem. However, in presence of convective instabilities (e.g. density-driven fingers) the diffusion scale has to be resolved only at early times to capture the evolution of infinitesimal random perturbations, whereas at later times fingers have developed and merged, allowing the use of a coarser numerical description. Based on this observation, we present an adaptive algorithm which splits the simulation into three stages: an onset stage in which a set of localized problems is solved independently to capture the initial growth of the instabilities; a transition stage in which the DMsFV method is used to couple local and global scales; and a global stage in which only a fully coarsened description of the problem is employed. The dissolution-diffusion-convection problem (which is typically studied in the context of CO2 sequestration) is chosen as an example to evaluate the accuracy of the adaptive algorithm. For this problem, the use of a coarse grid that does not resolve the fine-scale details at earlier times leads to a dramatic underestimation of mass influx and penetration depth. On the contrary, the solutions obtained with the adaptive algorithm are in good agreement with the reference solution (obtained with a fully refined discretization) and are able to capture total mass influx and penetration depth with excellent accuracy. This demonstrates the need and the effectiveness of modeling local details during the instability onset to capture large-scale features of the concentration patterns at later times. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Traditional coarsening schemes for AMG can, however, lead to computational complexity growth as problem size increases, resulting in increased memory use and execution time, and diminished scalability. Two new parallel AMG coarsening schemes are proposed that are based solely on enforcing a maximum independent set property, resulting in sparser coarse grids. The new coarsening techniques remedy memory and execution time complexity growth for various large three-dimensional (3D) problems. If used within AMG as a preconditioner for Krylov subspace methods, the resulting iterative methods tend to converge fast.

While numerical models for these processes have become commonplace in research and industry, the poor scalability of existing solution algorithms has limited the size and resolution of models that may be practically solved. In this work, we propose a two-stage Newton–Krylov solution algorithm to address this shortfall. The proposed solver exhibits rapid convergence, good parallel scalability, and is robust in the presence of highly heterogeneous material properties. The key to success of the solver is a block-preconditioning strategy that breaks the fully-coupled system of mass and momentum balance equations into simpler sub-problems that may be readily addressed using targeted algebraic methods. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the solver on challenging benchmark problems.},

abstract = {Simulation of multiphase poromechanics involves solving a multiphysics problem in which multiphase flow and transport are tightly coupled with the porous medium deformation. To capture this dynamic interplay, fully implicit methods, also known as monolithic approaches, are usually preferred. The main bottleneck of a monolithic approach is that it requires solution of large linear systems that result from the discretization and linearization of the governing balance equations. Because such systems are nonsymmetric, indefinite, and highly ill-conditioned, precondi- tioning is critical for fast convergence. Recently, most efforts in designing efficient preconditioners for multiphase poromechanics have been dominated by physics-based strategies. Current state-of- the-art ``black-box"" solvers such as algebraic multigrid (AMG) are ineffective because they cannot effectively capture the strong coupling between the mechanics and the flow subproblems, as well as the coupling inherent in the multiphase flow and transport process. In this work, we develop an algebraic framework based on multigrid reduction (MGR) that is suited for tightly coupled systems of PDEs. Using this framework, the decoupling between the equations is done algebraically through defining appropriate interpolation and restriction operators. One can then employ existing solvers for each of the decoupled blocks or design a new solver based on knowledge of the physics. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework when used as a ``black-box"" solver for multiphase poromechanics. We show that the framework is flexible to accommodate a wide range of scenarios, as well as efficient and scalable for large problems.},

We solve the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations using fully implicit (FI) and sequential-implicit (SI) solution schemes. The FI approach is attractive for general-purpose simulation due to its unconditional stability. However, the FI method requires the development of a complex thermo-compositional-mechanics framework for the nonlinear problems of interest, and that includes the construction of the full Jacobian matrix for the coupled multi-physics discrete system of equations. On the other hand, SI-based solution schemes allow for relatively fast development because different simulation modules can be coupled more easily. The challenge with SI schemes is that the nonlinear convergence rate depends strongly on the coupling strength across the physical mechanisms and on the details of the sequential updating strategy across the different physics modules. The flexible automatic differentiation-based framework described here allows for detailed assessment of the robustness and computational efficiency of different coupling schemes for a wide range of multi-physics subsurface problems.},

abstract = {To realize the potential of the latest high-performance computing (HPC) architectures for reservoir simulation, scalable linear solvers are necessary. We describe a parallel algebraic multiscale solver (AMS) for the pressure equation of heterogeneous reservoir models. AMS is a two-level algorithm that uses domain decomposition with a localization assumption. In AMS, basis functions, which are local (subdomain) solutions computed during the setup phase, are used to construct the coarse-scale system and gridtransfer operators between the fine and coarse levels. The solution phase is composed of two stages: global and local. The global stage involves solving the coarse-scale system and interpolating the solution to the fine grid. The local stage involves application of a smoother on the fine-scale approximation. The design and implementation of a scalable AMS on multicore and many-core architectures, including the decomposition, memory allocation, data flow, and compute kernels, are described in detail. These adaptations are necessary to obtain good scalability on state-of-the-art HPC systems. The specific methods and parameters, such as the coarsening ratio (Cr), basis-function solver, and relaxation scheme, have significant effects on the asymptotic convergence rate and parallel computational efficiency. The balance between convergence rate and parallel efficiency as a function of Cr and the local stage parameters is analyzed in detail. The performance of AMS is demonstrated using heterogeneous 3D reservoir models, including geostatistically generated fields and models derived from SPE10 (Christie and Blunt 2001). The problems range in size from several million to 128 million cells. AMS shows excellent behavior for handling fixed-size problems as a function of the number of cores (so-called strong scaling). Specifically, for a 128-million-cell problem, a ninefold speedup is obtained on a single-node 12-core shared-memory architecture (dual-socket multicore Intel Xeon E5-2620-v2), and more than 12-fold on a single-node 20-core shared-memory architecture (dualsocket multicore Intel Xeon E5-2690-v2). These are encouraging results given the limited memory bandwidth that cores can share within a single node, which tends to be the major bottleneck for truly scalable solvers. We also compare the robustness and performance of our method with the parallel system algebraic mutligrid (SAMG) solver (Stu ben 2012) from Fraunhofer SCAI.},

abstract = {Multiscale methods have been developed for accurate and efficient numerical solution of flow problems in large-scale heterogeneous reservoirs. A scalable and extendible Operator-Based Multiscale Method (OBMM) is described here. OBMM is cast as a general algebraic framework. It is natural and convenient to incorporate more physics in OBMM for multiscale computation. In OBMM, two operators are constructed: prolongation and restriction. The prolongation operator is constructed by assembling the multiscale basis functions. The specific form of the restriction operator depends on the coarse-scale discretization formulation (e.g., finite-volume or finite-element). The coarse-scale pressure equation is obtained algebraically by applying the prolongation and restriction operators to the fine-scale flow equations. Solving the coarse-scale equation results in a high-quality coarse-scale pressure. The fine-scale pressure can be reconstructed by applying the prolongation operator to the coarse-scale pressure. A conservative fine-scale velocity field is then reconstructed to solve the transport (saturation) equation. We describe the OBMM approach for multiscale modeling of compressible multiphase flow. We show that extension from incompressible to compressible flows is straightforward. No special treatment for compressibility is required. The efficiency of multiscale formulations over standard fine-scale methods is retained by OBMM. The accuracy of OBMM is demonstrated using several numerical examples including a challenging depletion problem in a strongly heterogeneous permeability field (SPE 10).

abstract = {The multiscale finite-volume (MSFV) method has been developed to solve multiphase flow problems on large and highly heterogeneous domains efficiently. It employs an auxiliary coarse grid, together with its dual, to define and solve a coarse-scale pressure problem. A set of basis functions, which are local solutions on dual cells, is used to interpolate the coarse-grid pressure and obtain an approximate fine-scale pressure distribution. However, if flow takes place in presence of gravity (or capillarity), the basis functions are not good interpolators. To treat this case correctly, a correction function is added to the basis function interpolated pressure. This function, which is similar to a supplementary basis function independent of the coarse-scale pressure, allows for a very accurate fine-scale approximation. In the coarse-scale pressure equation, it appears as an additional source term and can be regarded as a local correction to the coarse-scale operator: It modifies the fluxes across the coarse-cell interfaces defined by the basis functions. Given the closure assumption that localizes the pressure problem in a dual cell, the derivation of the local problem that defines the correction function is exact, and no additional hypothesis is needed. Therefore, as in the original MSFV method, the only closure approximation is the localization assumption. The numerical experiments performed for density-driven flow problems (counter-current flow and lock exchange) demonstrate excellent agreement between the MSFV solutions and the corresponding fine-scale reference solutions. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

abstract = {The Multiscale Finite-Volume (MsFV) method has been developed over the last decade to efficiently solve large reservoir models. The method projects the original pressure problem onto a second coarser grid, on which it is less expensive to solve, and then prolongates the approximated coarse solution back to the fine-scale grid. One characteristic of the MsFV algorithm is to allow the reconstruction of an approximate but fully conservative velocity field from the prolongated pressure. This makes the method particularly attractive for applications involving the solution of transport problems. Here, we present an extension of the MsFV method (MMsFV) that can employ multiple levels of coarsening instead of the single coarse level used in the standard algorithm. Whereas the coarse problem and the prolongation operators can be easily obtained by recursive application of the MsFV method, formulating an efficient reconstruction of the conservative velocity is not trivial. We devise a nested reconstruction procedure that is novel and has computational cost comparable with the MsFV reconstruction. By analyzing the computational complexity of the algorithm we show that the MMsFV method allows obtaining a conservative approximation of the fine-scale velocity more efficiently than the MsFV method. However, the accuracy of the solution deteriorates and MMsFV errors are larger than MsFV errors. By means of numerical test cases we demonstrate that, when the MMsFV operator is used as preconditioner in GMRES, the number of iterations necessary to achieve the same accuracy is larger than with the MsFV operator. For highly-heterogeneous permeability fields more than several hundreds of iterations might be required. Such a large number of iterations might be practically intractable. Therefore, we propose two ideas that can be used to control the number of iterations. The first is to combine the MMsFV coarse operator with an appropriate smoother in a two-step preconditioner; the second is to modify the localization assumptions used to solve edge problems. Our numerical tests show that both strategies lead to a significant reduction of the iterations and suggest that efficient MMsFV methods can be obtained by identifying optimal smoothers or devising better localizations for the edge problems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

High resolution characterizations of the mechanical properties of subsurface formations are essential for improving modeling predictions. Such detailed descriptions impose severe computational challenges and motivate the development of multiscale solution strategies. We propose a multiscale solution framework for the geomechanical equilibrium problem of heterogeneous porous media based on the finite-element method. After imposing a coarse-scale grid on the given fine-scale problem, the coarse-scale basis functions are obtained by solving local equilibrium problems within coarse elements. These basis functions form the restriction and prolongation operators used to obtain the coarse-scale system for the displacement-vector. Then, a two-stage preconditioner that couples the multiscale system with a smoother is derived for the iterative solution of the fine-scale linear system.

abstract = {An Algebraic Multiscale Solver (AMS) for the pressure equations arising from incompressible flow in heterogeneous porous media is described. In addition to the fine-scale system of equations, AMS requires information about the superimposed multiscale (dual and primal) coarse grids. AMS employs a global solver only at the coarse scale and allows for several types of local preconditioners at the fine scale. The convergence properties of AMS are studied for various combinations of global and local stages. These include MultiScale Finite-Element (MSFE) and MultiScale Finite-Volume (MSFV) methods as the global stage, and Correction Functions (CF), Block Incomplete Lower-Upper factorization (BILU), and ILU as local stages. The performance of the different preconditioning options is analyzed for a wide range of challenging test cases. The best overall performance is obtained by combining MSFE and ILU as the global and local preconditioners, respectively, followed by MSFV to ensure local mass conservation. Comparison between AMS and a widely used Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) solver [1] indicates that AMS is quite efficient. A very important advantage of AMS is that a conservative fine-scale velocity can be constructed after any MSFV stage. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A wide variety of multiscale methods have been proposed in the literature to reduce runtime and provide better scaling for the solution of Poisson-type equations modeling flow in porous media. We present a new multiscale restricted-smoothed basis (MsRSB) method that is designed to be applicable to both rectilinear grids and unstructured grids. Like many other multiscale methods, MsRSB relies on a coarse partition of the underlying fine grid and a set of local prolongation operators (multiscale basis functions) that map unknowns associated with the fine grid cells to unknowns associated with blocks in the coarse partition. These mappings are constructed by restricted smoothing: Starting from a constant, a localized iterative scheme is applied directly to the fine-scale discretization to compute prolongation operators that are consistent with the local properties of the differential operators.The resulting method has three main advantages: First of all, both the coarse and the fine grid can have general polyhedral geometry and unstructured topology. This means that partitions and good prolongation operators can easily be constructed for complex models involving high media contrasts and unstructured cell connections introduced by faults, pinch-outs, erosion, local grid refinement, etc. In particular, the coarse partition can be adapted to geological or flow-field properties represented on cells or faces to improve accuracy. Secondly, the method is accurate and robust when compared to existing multiscale methods and does not need expensive recomputation of local basis functions to account for transient behavior: Dynamic mobility changes are incorporated by continuing to iterate a few extra steps on existing basis functions. This way, the cost of updating the prolongation operators becomes proportional to the amount of change in fluid mobility and one reduces the need for expensive, tolerance-based updates. Finally, since the MsRSB method is formulated on top of a cell-centered, conservative, finite-volume method, it is applicable to any flow model in which one can isolate a pressure equation. Herein, we only discuss single and two-phase incompressible models. Compressible flow, e.g., as modeled by the black-oil equations, is discussed in a separate paper.},

abstract = {The multiscale finite-volume (MSFV) method for the solution of elliptic problems is extended to an efficient iterative algorithm that converges to the fine-scale numerical solution. The localization errors in the MSFV method are systematically reduced by updating the local boundary conditions with global information. This iterative multiscale finite-volume (i-MSFV) method allows the conservative reconstruction of the velocity field after any iteration, and the MSFV method is recovered, if the velocity field is reconstructed after the first iteration. Both the i-MSFV and the MSFV methods lead to substantial computational savings, where an approximate but locally conservative solution of an elliptic problem is required. In contrast to the MSFV method, the i-MSFV method allows a systematic reduction of the error in the multiscale approximation. Line relaxation in each direction is used as an efficient smoother at each iteration. This smoother is essential to obtain convergence in complex, highly anisotropic, heterogeneous domains. Numerical convergence of the method is verified for different test cases ranging from a standard Poisson equation to highly heterogeneous, anisotropic elliptic problems. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of the method for multiphase transport in porous media, it is shown that it is sufficient to apply the iterative smoothing procedure for the improvement of the localization assumptions only infrequently, i.e. not every time step. This result is crucial, since it shows that the overall efficiency of the i-MSFV algorithm is comparable with the original MSFV method. At the same time, the solutions are significantly improved, especially for very challenging cases. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

For the flow problem, we employ two different sets of basis functions for the reconstruction of a conservative fine-scale total velocity field. Our basis functions are designed to have local support, and that allows for adaptive computation of the flow field. We use a criterion based on the time change of the total mobility field to decide when and where to recompute our basis functions.

The method efficiently captures the effects of small scales on a coarse grid, is conservative, and treats tensor permeabilities correctly. The underlying idea is to construct transmissibilities that capture the local properties of the differential operator. This leads to a multi-point discretization scheme for the finite-volume solution algorithm. Transmissibilities for the MSFV have to be constructed only once as a preprocessing step and can be computed locally. Therefore this step is perfectly suited for massively parallel computers. Furthermore, a conservative fine-scale velocity field can be constructed from the coarse-scale pressure solution. Two sets of locally computed basis functions are employed. The first set of basis functions captures the small-scale heterogeneity of the underlying permeability field, and it is computed in order to construct the effective coarse-scale transmissibilities.

abstract = {The Multiscale Finite-Volume (MSFV) method has been recently developed and tested for multiphase-flow problems with simplified physics (i.e. incompressible flow without gravity and capillary effects) and proved robust, accurate and efficient. However, applications to practical problems necessitate extensions that enable the method to deal with more complex processes. In this paper we present a modified version of the MSFV algorithm that provides a suitable and natural framework to include additional physics. The algorithm consists of four main steps: computation of the local basis functions, which are used to extract the coarse-scale effective transmissibilities; solution of the coarse-scale pressure equation; reconstruction of conservative fine-scale fluxes; and solution of the transport equations. Within this framework, we develop a MSFV method for compressible multiphase flow. The basic idea is to compute the basis functions as in the case of incompressible flow such that they remain independent of the pressure. The effects of compressibility are taken into account in the solution of the coarse-scale pressure equation and, if necessary, in the reconstruction of the fine-scale fluxes. We consider three models with an increasing level of complexity in the flux reconstruction and test them for highly compressible flows (tracer transport in gas flow, imbibition and drainage of partially saturated reservoirs, depletion of gas-water reservoirs, and flooding of oil-gas reservoirs). We demonstrate that the MSFV method provides accurate solutions for compressible multiphase flow problems. Whereas slightly compressible flows can be treated with a very simple model, a more sophisticate flux reconstruction is needed to obtain accurate fine-scale saturation fields in highly compressible flows. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We present a novel hybrid (or multiphysics) algorithm, which couples pore-scale and Darcy descriptions of two-phase flow in porous media. The flow at the pore-scale is described by the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is used to model the evolution of the fluid-fluid interface. An extension of the Multiscale Finite Volume (MsFV) method is employed to construct the Darcy-scale problem. First, a set of local interpolators for pressure and velocity is constructed by solving the Navier-Stokes equations; then, a coarse mass-conservation problem is constructed by averaging the pore-scale velocity over the cells of a coarse grid, which act as control volumes; finally, a conservative pore-scale velocity field is reconstructed and used to advect the fluid-fluid interface. The method relies on the localization assumptions used to compute the interpolators (which are quite straightforward extensions of the standard MsFV) and on the postulate that the coarse-scale fluxes are proportional to the coarse-pressure differences. By numerical simulations of two-phase problems, we demonstrate that these assumptions provide hybrid solutions that are in good agreement with reference pore-scale solutions and are able to model the transition from stable to unstable flow regimes. Our hybrid method can naturally take advantage of several adaptive strategies and allows considering pore-scale fluxes only in some regions, while Darcy fluxes are used in the rest of the domain. Moreover, since the method relies on the assumption that the relationship between coarse-scale fluxes and pressure differences is local, it can be used as a numerical tool to investigate the limits of validity of Darcy's law and to understand the link between pore-scale quantities and their corresponding Darcy-scale variables. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a multiscale finite element method for solving a class of elliptic problems arising from composite materials and flows in porous media, which contain many spatial scales. The method is designed to efficiently capture the large scale behavior of the solution without resolving all the small scale features. This is accomplished by constructing the multiscale finite element base functions that are adaptive to the local property of the differential operator. Our method is applicable to general multiple-scale problems without restrictive assumptions. The construction of the base functions is fully decoupled from element to element; thus, the method is perfectly parallel and is naturally adapted to massively parallel computers. For the same reason, the method has the ability to handle extremely large degrees of freedom due to highly heterogeneous media, which are intractable by conventional finite element (difference) methods. In contrast to some empirical numerical upscaling methods, the multiscale method is systematic and self- consistent, which makes it easier to analyze. We give a brief analysis of the method, with emphasis on the "resonant sampling" effect. Then, we propose an oversampling technique to remove the resonance effect. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method through extensive numerical experiments, which include problems with random coefficients and problems with continuous scales.
